# Java Projects Repository

This repository contains three Java projects for different tasks:

1. Number Game
2. Student Grade Calculator
3. ATM Machine

## 1. Number Game

### Description
A number guessing game where the user must guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Additional features include a limited number of attempts, multiple rounds, and scoring based on the number of attempts.

### How to Run
1. Compile and run the `NumberGame.java` file.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the correct number.
3. You have a maximum of 5 attempts in each round. The faster you guess, the higher your score!
4. After each round, you can choose to play another round.

## 2. Student Grade Calculator

### Description
A program to calculate total marks, average percentage, and assign grades based on the average percentage achieved in various subjects.

### How to Run
1. Compile and run the `StudentGradeCalculator.java` file.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter marks for each subject.
3. The grading criteria will be displayed, and the program will calculate and display total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade.

## 3. ATM Machine

### Description
An implementation of a simple ATM machine with a user interface. It includes options for checking the balance, depositing, withdrawing, and exiting. Validation is implemented to ensure safe transactions.

### How to Run
1. Compile and run the `ATM.java` file.
2. Enter the initial balance for the user's bank account.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform transactions like checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing.
4. The program runs in an infinite loop until manually terminated.

## Project Structure

- `NumberGame.java`: Contains the implementation of the Number Game.
- `StudentGradeCalculator.java`: Contains the implementation of the Student Grade Calculator.
- `ATM.java`: Contains the ATM and BankAccount classes for the ATM Machine.
- `README.md`: You are here.

Feel free to explore each project's source code for a better understanding of the implementations.
